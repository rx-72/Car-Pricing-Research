# Car Pricing Research

Given a dataset which contained the characteristics of used vehicles and their prices, we wanted to explore key driving factors for used car prices. With this knowledge, our stakeholders can learn the intricacies of what customers prefer in a vehicle and shift their market more towards this thought bubble. With that in mind, our goal with this dataset is to then figure out what specific features and characteristics of a vehicle are the most important towards influencing its price and thus using this available knowledge to better our resoruces to satisfying customer needs and in turn making profit.
